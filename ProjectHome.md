Android Wi-Fi automatic switch, Wi-Fi Auto Toggle, turns Wi-Fi on when you enter a location in which you have used Wi-Fi and turns it off when you leave.
All you have to do is turn on Wi-Fi and connect to the network with Wi-Fi Auto Toggle running.


In order to save battery Wi-Fi Auto Toggle doesn't turn on Wi-Fi to find out the phone location. Instead it solely relies on cellular network.
Use of wireless networks must be enabled in Home -> Menu -> Settings -> Location & security -> Use wireless networks.
Unless GPS, which drains battery, is used, the accuracy of location provided by cellular network is very coarse.
Wi-Fi Auto Toggle works at its best when the Wi-Fi locations are relatively far apart.
